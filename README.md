## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. We want to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
We want to identify:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands?

## Technologies Used
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
plotly
scipy
seaborn
sklearn
statsmodels
